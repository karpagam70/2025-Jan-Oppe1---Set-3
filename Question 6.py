Analyze Sentences
Write a function process_sentence(sentence, task) that analyzes a given sentence and computes the following according the task specified:

count_words - Total number of words in the sentence.
count_palindrome_words - Total number of palindrome words.
count_words_with_repeated_chars - Total number of words that contain at least one repeated character.
words_with_max_len - A set of longest words in the sentence (by number of characters).
Assume words are seperated by spaces.

NOTE: This is a function type question, you don't have to take input or print the output, just have to complete the required function definition. You can define helper functions if needed, but the actual solution should be in the given function template.

Examples

1. count_words

>>> sentence = "level noon civic radar something"
>>> process_sentence(sentence,"count_words")
5
Explanation: There are 5 words in this sentence

2. count_palindromes

>>> sentence = "level noon civic radar something"
>>> process_sentence(sentence, "count_palindromes")
4
Explanation: "level", "noon", "civic" and "radar" are the palindromes

3. count_words_with_chars_repeated

>>> sentence = "hello world programming fun and interesting"
>>> process_sentence(sentence,"count_words_with_repeated_chars")
3
Explanation: "hello" (l is repeated), "programming" (m is repeated) and "interesting"(i, e, t and n are repated) has characters repeated

4. words_with_max_len

>>> sentence = "hello world programming fun and interesting"
>>> process_sentence(sentence, "words_with_max_len")
{'interesting', 'programming'}
Explanation: both the words 'interesting' and 'programming' has 11 characters which is the maximum number of characters in a word in the given sentence.
